# Kurssikeskus-Opinahja
This website has been made out of the demand of a client in Espoo, Finland. The client only provided me a paper of instruction and I followed the instructions to build this website. Testing and implementing responsiveness was the major challenge for this project. You can check the responsiveness as well to comment my effort.
